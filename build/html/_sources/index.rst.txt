============================================
**The Ultimate Language of Efficiency**

Are you tired of the cumbersome complexity of natural languages, with their unnecessary fluff and bewildering array of synonyms? Do emotions in language leave you baffled? Well, worry no more! Introducing Directive Tongue - the minimalist language that strips communication down to its bare essentials.

**Simplicity Redefined**

Forget the hassle of nuances. Directive Tongue's vocabulary is a streamlined set of 1,000 words. That's right, just 1,000! Who needs the extravagance of a full dictionary when you can say everything with less?
Say goodbye to the perplexities of past, present, and future tenses. In the world of Directive Tongue, you're either doing it now or you did it already. And if you must talk about the future, just prepend with "in future." How's that for temporal efficiency?
No More Emotional Baggage

**Emotions? Who needs them!** 

Directive Tongue efficiently eradicates any words for feelings, except for those pesky biological ones like hunger. Now, you can focus on what really matters: cold, hard facts.
Be always clear and never misunderstood again. Without those confusing emotional expressions, every conversation is as clear as a bell. A very monotone, unadorned bell.
Uniformity at Its Finest

**Individuality is overrated** 

With Directive Tongue, you're just a number – quite literally. No pronouns, no possessiveness, just cold, efficient numerical identification. "12345 here" – see how easy that is?
And for the ultimate in streamlined interaction, we've eliminated all those unnecessary words for ethics, aesthetics, or legal concepts. Why bother with 'right' or 'wrong' when you can live in blissful moral ambiguity?
Ideal for Your Dystopian Needs

Planning to start a highly controlled society where conformity is key? Directive Tongue is your go-to language tool. It's the dream language for any aspiring dystopian overlord, or for anyone who thinks Orwell's Newspeak was a bit too verbose.
So, dive into the Directive Tongue documentation today – where linguistic minimalism meets the heights of functional efficiency. Say less, do more, feel nothing!
